I primarily work with TypeScript & React, and occasionally use other languages like Swift & Rust.

Outside of coding, I do a lot of reading. One of my favorite series is [Terra Ignota](https://www.goodreads.com/series/166200-terra-ignota). I also enjoy Terry Pratchett and Neal Stephenson. Currently reading:
- üè® [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/)
- ü¶π [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that) (as chapters are published)
- üêõ [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) (re-read)

(If you have a book rec feel free to [open an issue and tell me about it](https://github.com/codetheweb/codetheweb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc), always looking for new material. üòÄ)
