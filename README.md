# Hi, I'm Max.

I primarily work with TypeScript & React, and occasionally use other languages like Swift & Rust.

🧑‍💻 I'm currently building an API to the physical world at [Seam](https://www.getseam.com/).

- 💥 want a modern, open-source, and free xkcd app? Check out [XKCDY](https://xkcdy.com/).
- 🎶 need a music bot for your Discord server? Try [Muse](https://github.com/codetheweb/muse/tree/129d121364c7e976c7bf5e2da3976da230058d77) or [Aoede](https://github.com/codetheweb/aoede).
- 💡 want to control those crappy IoT devices you bought on Amazon with a custom script? You probably need [TuyAPI](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi).

My [portfolio](https://maxisom.me/) has more details on most of my side projects.

✍️ I published my first blog post this year: [Applying 5 million pixel changes per second with Rust & wgpu](https://maxisom.me/posts/applying-5-million-pixel-updates-per-second).

Outside of coding, I do a lot of reading. One of my favorite series is [Terra Ignota](https://www.goodreads.com/series/166200-terra-ignota). I also enjoy Terry Pratchett and Neal Stephenson. Currently reading:

- 🏨 [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/)
- 🪐 [Project Hail Mary](https://bookshop.org/p/books/project-hail-mary-andy-weir/18644162?ean=9780593135228)

Recently finished books that you should check out:

- 📅 [Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/01/four-thousand-weeks-by-oliver-burkeman-review-a-brief-treatise-on-time): an antithesis to traditional time management. Embrace your limitations—life is short.

(If you have a book rec feel free to [open an issue and tell me about it](https://github.com/codetheweb/codetheweb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc), always looking for new material. 😀)

[leech](https://github.com/kemayo/leech) is a fantastic tool for turning web serials into something you can read on your Kindle. Thanks [@kemayo](https://github.com/kemayo)!

🎮 I'm also currently attempting to build a dyson sphere in Dyson Sphere Program
